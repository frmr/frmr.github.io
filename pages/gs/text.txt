This planet generator is a test bench for the <a href="../cck/cck.html">Continent Construction Kit</a> built with C++ and OpenGL 3. It divides the world into tiles and generates biomes and rivers based on the CCK output. A voronoi sphere was used to avoid the distortions that would appear towards the poles on a flat map.
The first screenshot shows how the CCK can be used to colour the tiles according to their altitude. Light green represent lowlands, dark green represents hills and grey represents mountains.
The second screenshot shows the biomes that are created using the ID output from the CCK, which then spread outward from their point of origin, taking terrain into account, to fill the continent. Green represents grassland, grey represents tundra, orange represents semi-arid and yellow represents desert. Darker shades of these colours represent higher altitudes.
The third screenshot shows the addition of river basins in black. Rivers start in hills or mountains and find their way to the sea.
The last screenshot shows how the result of the environment generation algorithms can be used to apply textures to the surface of the globe. These textures are procedurally generated at run-time using random noise.
