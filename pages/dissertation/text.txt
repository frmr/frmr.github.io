Task parallelism is a well-known approach to writing parallel applications, but literature evaluating frameworks providing support for task parallelism on modern hardware is rare. In this report, four benchmarks are developed to evaluate the performance of task parallelism on the Intel Xeon processor and Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor.
Two common task parallelism frameworks, Cilk Plus and OpenMP, are tested against serial implementations of the same benchmarks to help produce recommendations for maximising performance of task parallel applications. The granularity of tasks is found to be a key aspect in achieving peak performance, while other factors reported in the literature, such as automatic vectorisation, are found to be less important. For small work-loads, the host machine containing two Xeon processors is found to outperform a single Xeon Phi coprocessor, but this difference is found to be less severe when the work-load increases.
