Wakarahende ("I don't understand" in Osaka dialect) is a website for learning Japanese vocabulary and kanji (Chinese characters). The server backend is written in C++, using a small HTTP library. The frontend is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. See <a href="https://wakarahen.de">wakarahen.de</a>.
Kanji are Chinese characters used for writing Japanese. Each kanji has one or more meanings. Several kanji with certain meanings are often combined to create words with intuitive meanings. For example, 'battery' (電池) is composed of the characters 電 (electricity) and 池 (pool).
It can be difficult to learn vocabulary and kanji separately. It is easier to remember a word if you know the kanji it is written with. It is also easier to remember the meaning and pronunciation of a given kanji if you know several words in which it appears. In this way, vocabulary and kanji knowledge reinforce each other.
While preparing for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, I developed a method to learn vocabulary and kanji more easily. Wakarahende uses a flashcard system to test and reinforce the user's knowledge. It introduces new words based on their existing kanji knowledge. For example, if the user has demonstrated knowledge of the word 電池 (battery), Wakarahende will be more likely to introduce new words like 電気 (electricity) and 電話 (telephone).
As a result, the user is usually already familiar with some kanji in a word when first introduced to it. This makes the new word easier to learn, and learning the new word reinforces knowledge of the kanji it contains.
In developing Wakarahende, I used a minimum viable product approach. Further development will involve improving the language data, adding more quiz types and creating a mobile app.
